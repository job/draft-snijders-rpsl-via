[15:38] <job> hi
[21:12] <job> hi
[21:12] <nick-2128-p> ohai
[21:13] <job> i find it hard to part ways like this
[21:13] <job> in essence i expected our partnership to be one of the pillars of making it through the whole clown circus
[21:13] <job> could you do me a small favor, and read it once? :)
[21:14] <job> tell me what is missing or wrong, and after that i'll look for another guy to help
[21:37] <job> if 1 review is also unpossible, feel free to tell me
[21:46] <nick-2128-p> the general idea is ok
[21:47] <nick-2128-p> it possibly needs some set theory done regarding how the grammar works
[21:47] <nick-2128-p> needs worked examples
[21:47] <nick-2128-p> which are both reproducable and provable
[21:48] <nick-2128-p> needs less about bgp community-based filtering
[21:48] <nick-2128-p> needs some formalities about precedence
[21:49] <nick-2128-p> i.e. best match wins, that sort of thing
[21:49] <job> but that has already been described in another rfc
[21:50] <nick-2128-p> re: community filtering, it needs to say that the problem 
    is to provide a per-client based routing policy via an intermediate system, 
    and that existing methods which use bgp communities break with 32 bit asns
[21:50] <nick-2128-p> very simply - there's too much detail there no

1.  Introduction

   The Routing Policy Specification Language [RFC4012] allows operators
   to specify routing policies regarding directly adjacent networks
   through various import and export attributes.  These attributes only
   apply to directly adjacent networks.

   This document proposes to extend RPSL according to the following
   goals and requirements:

      Provide a way to describe what an adjacent network could use as
      routing policy towards its adjacent networks.

      The extension should be backward compatible with minimal impact on
      existing tools and processes, following Section 10 of [RFC2622].

   The addition of a 'via' keyword in import and export related
   attributes will especially help participants of Multi-Lateral Peering
   services to inform the intermediate autonomous system what routing
   policy should be applied towards other participants.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft         The 'via' keyword in RPSL                May 2013


   The via keyword specifically benefits operators whom were assigned a
   32 bit AS Number and transit providers when participating in Multi-
   Lateral Peering Agreements facilitated by a Route Server.

   Often Route Server operators overload BGP Communities [RFC1997]) to
   facilitate signalling of desired routing policy between the
   participants and the Route Server.  Because BGP Communities have a
   length of 32 bit, it is not possible to signal a 32 bit AS Number
   coupled with an action.  In practise this means Route Server
   participants whom use a 32 bit AS Number cannot specifically be
   included or excluded during path distribution calculations on the
   Route Server unless a mapping system is applied.

   Transit providers often uphold a routing policy which intents that
   the transit provider does not want to exchange paths with its
   downstream customers through Route Servers.  The via keyword allows
   transit providers to participate in Multi-Lateral Peering services
   while instructing Route Server operators through a simple routing
   policy specification that paths should not be distributed to
   downstream customers and reducing the likelyhood of Path Hiding on
   the Route Server.

4.  Import and Export Via Syntax and Semantics

   The via keyword can be used with the following policy attributes:
   import: export: mp-import: mp-export:

   The syntax for these attributes is as follows:

   Attribute  Value                                         Type
   import     [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
              [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
              from <peering-2> [action <action-1>]
              . . .
              [via <peering-3>]                             optional,
              from <peering-N> [action <action-N>]
              accept <filter>
   export     [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
              [via <peering-1>]                             optional,

              announce <filter>

   mp-import  [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
              [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
              [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
              from <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              . . .
              [via <peering-3>]                             optional,
              from <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              accept <mp-filter> [;]

   mp-export  [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,

              [via peering-1>]                              optional,
              to <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              . . .
              [via peering-3>]                              optional,
              to <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              announce <mp-filter> [;]


                                 Figure 1

   The via keyword is optional, and should be ignored by implementations
   which do not support interpretation of the via keyword.

   In the above example <peering-1> and <peering-3> are directly
   adjacent networks, for instance a Multi-Lateral Peering service.
   <peering-2> is a non-adjacent network.

5.  Example Usage

   Putting it all together:

      aut-num: AS5580
      import: via AS6777
                   from AS15562
                   action pref = 2;
                   accept AS-SNIJDERS
      import: via AS6777
                   from AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS
                   accept NOT ANY
      import: via AS6777 from AS15562
                   from AS1
                   from AS2
                   via AS3 from AS4
                   accept PeerAS
      mp-import: afi ipv6.unicast via AS6777
                   from AS15562 accept AS-SNIJDERS
      mp-import: via AS6777
                   from AS65551 accept AS-SET-FROM-32BIT-ASN
      export: via AS6777
                   to AS15562 action community.={5580:40};
                   announce AS-ATRATO
      export: via AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS
                   to AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS announce NOT ANY
      mp-export: afi ipv6.unicast via AS6777
                   to AS15562 announce AS-ATRATO
      mp-export: via AS6777
                   to AS65551 announce AS-ATRATO


                                 Figure 2

   In the above examples AS5580 and AS15562 are Route Server
   participants.  AS65551 is a participant whom has been assigned a 32
   bit AS Number.  AS6777 functions as a Route Server and AS-SET AS5580
   :AS-ROUTESERVERS contains a list of Route Server AS Numbers.  AS-SET
   AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS contains a list of downstream transit customers
   from AS5580.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this specification.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The new set of mechanisms for route servers does not require any new
   allocations from IANA.

   'via' is a better keyword than 'through' or 'thru'.

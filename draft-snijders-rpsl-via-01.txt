Internet-Draft         The via attributes in RPSL            August 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Routing Policy Specification Language [RFC4012] allows operators
   to specify routing policies regarding directly adjacent networks
   through various import and export attributes.  These attributes only
   apply to directly adjacent networks.

   This document proposes to extend RPSL according to the following
   goals and requirements:

   o  Provide a way to describe what an adjacent network could use as
      routing policy towards its adjacent networks.

   o  The extension should be backward compatible with minimal impact on
      existing tools and processes, following Section 10.2 of [RFC2622].

   The addition of the 'via-import' and 'via-export' attributes in the
   aut-num Class will especially help participants of Multi-Lateral
   Peering services to inform the intermediate autonomous system what
   routing policy should be applied towards other participants.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Background

   The via keyword specifically benefits operators whom were assigned a
   32 bit AS Number and transit providers when participating in Multi-
   Lateral Peering Agreements facilitated by a Route Server.

   Often Route Server operators overload BGP Communities [RFC1997]) to
   facilitate signalling of desired routing policy between the
   participants and the Route Server.  Because BGP Communities have a
   length of 32 bit, it is not possible to signal a 32 bit AS Number
   coupled with an action.  In practise this means Route Server
   participants whom use a 32 bit AS Number cannot specifically be
   included or excluded during path distribution calculations on the
   Route Server unless a mapping system is applied.

   Transit providers often uphold a routing policy which intents that
   the transit provider does not want to exchange paths with its
   downstream customers through Route Servers.  The via keyword allows

   transit providers to participate in Multi-Lateral Peering services
   while instructing Route Server operators through a simple routing
   policy specification that paths should not be distributed to
   downstream customers and reducing the likelyhood of Path Hiding on
   the Route Server.


4.  Import and Export Via Syntax and Semantics

   The two attributes can be used within the aut-num class.

      import-via:

      export-via:

   The syntax for these attributes is as follows:

   Attribute  Value                                         Type
   import-via [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
              [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
              <mp-peering-1>
              from <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              . . .
              &#65533;mp-peering-3>
              from <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              accept <mp-filter> [;]

   export-via [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
              [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
              <mp-peering-1>
              to <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              . . .
              <mp-peering-3>
              to <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              announce <mp-filter> [;]


                                 Figure 1

   The import-via and export-via attributes are optional, and should be
   ignored by implementations which do not support interpretation of
   those attributes.  The syntax closely mimicks the mp-import and mp-
   export attributes described in Section 2.5 of [RFC4012], with the
   exception that before the "from" and "to" keywords an &klt;mp-
   peering> is defined to indicate the common AS between two non-
   adjacent networks.

   In the above example <peering-1> and <peering-3> are directly

   adjacent networks, for instance a Multi-Lateral Peering service.
   <peering-2> is a non-adjacent network.


5.  Example Usage

   Putting it all together:

      aut-num: AS5580
      import-via: AS6777
                   from AS15562
                   action pref = 2;
                   accept AS-SNIJDERS
      export-via: AS6777
                   to AS15562 action community.={5580:40};
                   announce AS-ATRATO
      import-via: AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS
                   from AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS
                   accept NOT ANY
      export-via: AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS
                   to AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS announce NOT ANY
      import-via: AS6777
                   from AS4247483647
                   accept AS4247483647
      export-via: AS6777
                   to AS4247483647 action community.={5580:40};
                   announce AS-ATRATO

                                 Figure 2

   In the above examples AS5580 and AS15562 are Route Server
   participants.  AS4247483647 is a participant whom has been assigned a
   32 bit AS Number.  AS6777 functions as a Route Server
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server] and AS-SET AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS
   contains a list of Route Server AS Numbers.  AS-SET AS5580:AS-
   CUSTOMERS contains a list of downstream transit customers from
   AS5580.

   The intention of the above policy would be to enable the exchange of
   NLRI's through AS6777 with two parties: AS15562 and AS4247483647, yet
   prevent the Route Server from distributing NLRI's announced by AS5580
   towards customers of said network.  Publishing the policy that AS5580
   will not accept customer routes through the Route Server can help
   counteract the "path hiding" phenomenon as described in Section 2.3.1
   of [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server], as the Route Server now is
   informed which NLRI's should not be considered in the best path
   selection process.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this specification.


7.  IANA Considerations

   The new set of mechanisms for route servers does not require any new
   allocations from IANA.


8.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Remko van Mook for confirming that
   'via' is a better keyword than 'through' or 'thru', Nick Hilliard for
   his unparalleled support and Jeffrey Haas for providing historic
   perspective.

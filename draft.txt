    <Table of contents>


1.  Introduction

   The Routing Policy Specification Language [RFC4012] allows operators
   to specify routing policies regarding directly adjacent networks
   through various import and export attributes. These attributes only
   apply to directly adjacent networks. 
   
   This document proposes to extend RPSL according to the following
   goals and requirements:

   o Provide a way to describe what an adjacent network could use
     as routing policy towards its adjacent networks.
   o The extension should be backward compatible with minimal impact on
     existing tools and processes, following Section 10 of [RFC2622].
  
   The addition of a 'via' keyword in import and export related attributes
   will especially help participants of Multi-Lateral Peering services to
   inform the intermediate autonomous system what routing policy should be
   applied towards other participants. 


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Background

   The via keyword specifically benefits operators whom were assigned
   a 32 bit AS Number and transit providers when participating in
   Multi-Lateral Peering Agreements facilitated by a Route Server. 

   Often Route Server operators overload BGP Communities [RFC1997] to
   facilitate signalling of desired routing policy between the participants
   and the Route Server. Because BGP Communities have a length of 32 bit,
   it is not possible to signal a 32 bit AS Number coupled with an action.
   In practise this means Route Server participants whom use a 32 bit AS
   Number cannot specifically be included or excluded during path
   distribution calculations on the Route Server unless a mapping system
   is applied. 

   Transit providers often uphold a routing policy which expresses that
   the transit provider does not want to exchange paths with its downstream
   customers. The via keyword allows transit providers to participate in
   Multi-Lateral Peering services while instructing Route Server operators
   through a simple routing policy specification that paths should not
   be distributed to downstream customers and reducing the likelyhood
   of Path Hiding on the Route Server.

4.  Import and Export Via Syntax and Semantics

  The via keyword can be used with the following policy attributes:

     import:
     export:
     mp-import:
     mp-export:

  The syntax for these attributes is as follows:

  Attribute  Value                                         Type
  import     [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
             from <peering-2> [action <action-1>]
             . . .
             [via <peering-3>]                             optional,
             from <peering-N> [action <action-N>]
             accept <filter>
  export     [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
             to <peering-2> [action <action-1>]             
             . . .
             [via <peering-3>]                             optional,
             to <peering-N> [action <action-N>]
             announce <filter>
  
  mp-import  [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
             [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
             from <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             . . .
             [via <peering-3>]                             optional,
             from <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             accept <mp-filter> [;]

  mp-export  [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
             [via peering-1>]                              optional,
             to <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             . . .
             [via peering-3>]                              optional,
             to <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             announce <mp-filter> [;]
  
  The via keyword is optional, and should be ignored by implementations
  which do not support interpretation of the via keyword. 

  In the above example <peering-1> and <peering-3> are directly adjacent
  networks, for instance a Multi-Lateral Peering service. <peering-2> is a
  non-adjacent network.

5. Example Usage
   
  Here are examples!

  aut-num: AS5580
  import: via AS6777
          from AS15562
          action pref = 2;
          accept AS-SNIJDERS
  import: via AS6777
          from AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS
          accept NOT ANY
  import: via AS6777 from AS15562
          from AS1
          from AS2
          via AS3 from AS4
          accept PeerAS
  mp-import: afi ipv6.unicast via AS6777 from AS15562 accept AS-SNIJDERS
  
  export: via AS6777
          to AS15562 action community.={5580:40};
          announce AS-ATRATO
  export: via AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS to AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS announce NOT ANY
  mp-export: afi ipv6.unicast via AS6777 to AS15562 announce AS-ATRATO
          
           
6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this specification.  
   

7.  IANA Considerations

  Maybe the via keyword must be added to the dictionary, but afaik
  there is no IANA registry for RPSL madness.

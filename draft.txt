1.  Introduction

   The Routing Policy Specification Language [RFC4012] allows operators
   to specify routing policies regarding directly adjacent networks
   through various import and export attributes. These attributes only
   apply to directly adjacent networks. 
   
   This document proposes to extend RPSL according to the following
   goals and requirements:

   o Provide a way to describe what an adjacent network could use
     as routing policy towards its adjacent networks.
   o The extension should be backward compatible with minimal impact on
     existing tools and processes, following Section 10 of [RFC2622].
  
   The addition of a 'via' keyword in import and export related attributes
   will especially help participants of Multi-Lateral Peering services to
   inform the intermediate autonomous system what routing policy should be
   applied towards other participants.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Import and Export Via Syntax and Semantics

  The via keyword can be used with the following policy attributes:

     import:
     export:
     mp-import:
     mp-export:

  The syntax for these attributes is as follows:

  Attribute  Value                                         Type
  import     [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
             [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             from <peering-2> [action <action-1>]
             . . .
             from <peering-N> [action <action-N>]
             accept <filter>
  export     [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
             [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             to <peering-2> [action <action-1>]             
             . . .
             to <peering-N> [action <action-N>]
             announce <filter>
  
  mp-import  [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
             [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
             from <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             . . .
             from <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             accept <mp-filter> [;]

  mp-export  [via peering-1>]                              optional,
             [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
             to <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             . . .
             to <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             announce <mp-filter> [;]
  
  The via specification is optional, and should be ignore by implementations
  which do not support interpretation of the via keyword.

  export: via AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS to AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS
          announce NOT ANY
  mp-export: via AS6777
             afi ipv6.unicast to AS15562 announce AS-ATRATO

    <Table of contents>


1.  Introduction

   The Routing Policy Specification Language [RFC4012] allows operators
   to specify routing policies regarding directly adjacent networks
   through various import and export attributes. These attributes only
   apply to directly adjacent networks. 
   
   This document proposes to extend RPSL according to the following
   goals and requirements:

   o Provide a way to describe what an adjacent network could use
     as routing policy towards its adjacent networks.
   o The extension should be backward compatible with minimal impact on
     existing tools and processes, following Section 10 of [RFC2622].
  
   The addition of a 'via' keyword in import and export related attributes
   will especially help participants of Multi-Lateral Peering services to
   inform the intermediate autonomous system what routing policy should be
   applied towards other participants. 


2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Background

   The via keyword specifically benefits operators whom were assigned
   a 32 bit AS Number and transit providers when participating in
   Multi-Lateral Peering Agreements facilitated by a Route Server. 

   Often Route Server operators overload BGP Communities [RFC1997] to
   facilitate signalling of desired routing policy between the participants
   and the Route Server. Because BGP Communities have a length of 32 bit,
   it is not possible to signal a 32 bit AS Number coupled with an action.
   In practise this means Route Server participants whom use a 32 bit AS
   Number cannot specifically be included or excluded during path
   distribution calculations on the Route Server unless a mapping system
   is applied. 

   Transit providers often uphold a routing policy which intents that
   the transit provider does not want to exchange paths with its downstream
   customers through Route Servers. The via keyword allows transit providers
   to participate in Multi-Lateral Peering services while instructing Route
   Server operators through a simple routing policy specification that paths 
   should not be distributed to downstream customers and reducing the 
   likelyhood of Path Hiding on the Route Server.

4.  Import and Export Via Syntax and Semantics

  The via keyword can be used with the following policy attributes:

     import:
     export:
     mp-import:
     mp-export:

  The syntax for these attributes is as follows:

  Attribute  Value                                         Type
  import     [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
             from <peering-2> [action <action-1>]
             . . .
             [via <peering-3>]                             optional,
             from <peering-N> [action <action-N>]
             accept <filter>
  export     [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
             to <peering-2> [action <action-1>]             
             . . .
             [via <peering-3>]                             optional,
             to <peering-N> [action <action-N>]
             announce <filter>
  
  mp-import  [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
             [via <peering-1>]                             optional,
             from <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             . . .
             [via <peering-3>]                             optional,
             from <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             accept <mp-filter> [;]

  mp-export  [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
             [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
             [via peering-1>]                              optional,
             to <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             . . .
             [via peering-3>]                              optional,
             to <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
             announce <mp-filter> [;]
  
  The via keyword is optional, and should be ignored by implementations
  which do not support interpretation of the via keyword. 

  In the above example <peering-1> and <peering-3> are directly adjacent
  networks, for instance a Multi-Lateral Peering service. <peering-2> is a
  non-adjacent network.

5. Example Usage
   
  Here are examples!

     aut-num: AS5580
     import: via AS6777
             from AS15562
             action pref = 2;
             accept AS-SNIJDERS
     import: via AS6777
             from AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS
             accept NOT ANY
     import: via AS6777 from AS15562
             from AS1
             from AS2
             via AS3 from AS4
             accept PeerAS
     mp-import: afi ipv6.unicast via AS6777 from AS15562 accept AS-SNIJDERS
     mp-import: via AS6777 from AS65551 accept AS-SET-FROM-32BIT-ASN
     export: via AS6777
             to AS15562 action community.={5580:40};
             announce AS-ATRATO
     export: via AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS to AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS announce NOT ANY
     mp-export: afi ipv6.unicast via AS6777 to AS15562 announce AS-ATRATO
     mp-export: via AS6777 to AS65551 announce AS-ATRATO
   
  In the above examples AS5580 and AS15562 are Route Server participants.
  AS65551 is a participant whom has been assigned a 32 bit AS Number.
  AS6777 functions as a Route Server and AS-SET AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS
  contains a list of Route Server AS Numbers. AS-SET AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS
  contains a list of downstream transit customers from AS5580. 

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this specification.  
   

7.  IANA Considerations

  Maybe the via keyword must be added to the dictionary, but afaik
  there is no IANA registry for RPSL madness.

Internet-Draft         The via attributes in RPSL            August 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Routing Policy Specification Language [RFC4012] allows operators
   to specify routing policies regarding directly adjacent networks
   through various import and export attributes.  These attributes only
   apply to directly adjacent networks.

   This document proposes to extend RPSL according to the following
   goals and requirements:

   o  Provide a way for network (A) to describe what an adjacent network
      (B) could use as routing policy towards its adjacent networks (C,
      D, E ..  N).

   o  The extension should be backward compatible with minimal impact on
      existing tools and processes, following Section 10.2 of [RFC2622].

   The addition of the "import-via" and "export-via" attributes in the
   aut-num Class will especially help participants of Multi-Lateral
   Peering services to inform the intermediate autonomous system what
   routing policy should be applied towards other participants.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


3.  Background

   The via keyword specifically benefits operators who were assigned a
   32 bit AS Number and transit providers when participating in Multi-
   Lateral Peering Agreements facilitated by a Route Server.

   Often Route Server operators overload BGP Communities [RFC1997]) to
   facilitate signaling of desired routing policy between the
   participants and the Route Server.  Because BGP Communities have a
   length of 32 bit, it is not possible to signal a 32 bit AS Number
   coupled with an action.  In practise this means Route Server
   participants who use a 32 bit AS Number cannot specifically be
   included or excluded during path distribution calculations on the
   Route Server unless a mapping system is applied.

   Transit providers often have a routing policy which states that the
   transit provider does not want to exchange paths with its downstream

   customers through Route Servers via public Internet Exchanges.  The
   import-via and export-via attributes allow transit providers to
   participate in Multi-Lateral Peering services while instructing Route
   Server operators through a simple routing policy specification that
   paths should not be distributed to downstream customers and reducing
   the likelihood of Path Hiding on the Route Server.


4.  Import and Export Via Syntax and Semantics

   The two attributes can be used within the aut-num class.

      import-via:

      export-via:

   The syntax for these attributes is as follows:

   Attribute  Value                                         Type
   import-via [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
              [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
              <mp-peering-1>
              from <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              . . .
              <mp-peering-3>
              from <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              accept <mp-filter> [;]

   export-via [protocol <protocol-1>] [into <protocol-2>]   optional,
              [afi <afi-list>]                              multi-valued
              <mp-peering-1>
              to <mp-peering-2> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              . . .
              <mp-peering-3>
              to <mp-peering-M> [action <action-1>; ... <action-N>;]
              announce <mp-filter> [;]


                                 Figure 1

   The import-via and export-via attributes are optional, and should be
   ignored by implementations which do not support interpretation of
   those attributes.  The syntax closely mimics the mp-import and mp-
   export attributes described in Section 2.5 of [RFC4012], with the
   exception that before the "from" and "to" keywords an <mp-peering> is
   defined to indicate the common AS between two non-adjacent networks.

   In the above example <peering-1> and <peering-3> are directly

   adjacent networks, for instance a Multi-Lateral Peering service.
   <peering-2> is a non-adjacent network.


5.  Example Usage

   Putting it all together:

      aut-num: AS5580
      import-via: AS6777
                   from AS15562
                   action pref = 2;
                   accept AS-SNIJDERS
      export-via: AS6777
                   to AS15562 action community.={5580:40};
                   announce AS-ATRATO
      import-via: AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS
                   from AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS
                   accept NOT ANY
      export-via: AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS
                   to AS5580:AS-CUSTOMERS announce NOT ANY
      import-via: AS6777
                   from AS4247483647
                   accept AS4247483647
      export-via: AS6777
                   to AS4247483647 action community.={5580:40};
                   announce AS-ATRATO

                                 Figure 2

   In the above examples AS5580 and AS15562 are Route Server
   participants.  AS4247483647 is a participant who has been assigned a
   32 bit AS Number.  AS6777 functions as a Route Server
   [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server] and AS-SET AS5580:AS-ROUTESERVERS
   contains a list of Route Server AS Numbers.  AS-SET AS5580:AS-
   CUSTOMERS contains a list of downstream transit customers from
   AS5580.

   The intention of the above policy would be to enable the exchange of
   NLRI's through AS6777 with two parties: AS15562 and AS4247483647, yet
   prevent the Route Server from distributing NLRI's announced by AS5580
   towards customers of said network.  Publishing the policy that AS5580
   will not accept customer routes through the Route Server can help
   counteract the "path hiding" phenomenon as described in Section 2.3.1
   of [I-D.ietf-idr-ix-bgp-route-server], as the Route Server now is
   informed which NLRI's should not be considered in the best path
   selection process.

6.  Ambiguity Resolution

   The same peering can be covered by more than one "via" policy
   attribute or by a combination of multi-protocol policy attributes, or
   multi-protocol policy attributes (when specifying IPv4 unicast
   policy) and the previously defined IPv4 unicast policy attributes.
   In these cases, implementations should follow the specification-order
   rule as defined in Section 6.4 of RFC 2622 [1].  Operators should
   take note that in order to break ambiguity, the action corresponding
   to the first peering specification is used.

   Consider the following example regarding ambiguity resolution.

    aut-num: AS5580
    export:     to AS6777 195.69.144.255 announce AS5580
    export-via: AS6777 195.69.144.255 to AS-AMS-IX-RS announce AS-ATRATO

                                 Figure 3

   As both policy specifications cover the same peering with AS6777,
   specification-order rule is used and Route Server AS6777
   195.69.144.255 should only accept AS5580, instead of AS-ATRATO, even
   though the export-via specification is more specific.  If the
   intended policy was to announce all routes which can be resolved
   through AS-ATRATO on this particular peering, the operator should
   have specified:

    aut-num: AS5580
    export-via: AS6777 195.69.144.255 to AS-AMS-IX-RS announce AS-ATRATO
    export:     to AS6777 195.69.144.255 announce AS5580

                                 Figure 4


7.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this specification.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

   "via" is a better keyword than 'through' or 'thru', Nick Hilliard for
